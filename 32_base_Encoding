# 🔢 Custom Base-32 Encoding System

## 🚀 Overview

Welcome! This repository presents a **Custom Base-32 Encoding System** designed to boost data representation, readability, and error prevention in digital communications. Unlike traditional Base-32 and Base-16 encoding schemes, this custom system removes visually ambiguous characters (such as `I`, `O`, and `L`) that often lead to transcription errors. The result? A more robust, user-friendly, and efficient encoding method for a wide range of applications.

## ❓ Why a Custom Base-32 Encoding?

Traditional encoding systems suffer from:
- 👀 **Visual Ambiguities:** Characters like `I`, `O`, and `L` often get mixed up with numbers like `1` and `0`.
- 📝 **Transcription Errors:** Manual data entry is error-prone due to lookalike characters.
- 🫣 **Limited Readability:** Especially critical in fields like cryptography, networking, and data storage.

The **Custom Base-32 Encoding System** solves these problems by providing a character set with clear, distinct characters.

## 🔡 Custom Base-32 Alphabet

The modified character set eliminates ambiguous characters and uses the following 32 symbols:

```
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K,
M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
```

- ❌ **No**: I, O, L
- 👌 **Distinct** and easy to recognize
- 🧮 Each character represents 5 bits of binary data

## 🛠️ Encoding Process

1. **Convert binary data** into 5-bit groups.
2. **Map each group** to a character in the custom Base-32 alphabet.
3. **Add padding** if necessary to standardize output length.

### 🧑‍💻 Example

Encoding the string `"Data"` (`ASCII: 68, 97, 116, 97`):
- Convert to binary
- Split into 5-bit chunks
- Map to the custom alphabet
- Result: compact, readable, and free of confusing characters
